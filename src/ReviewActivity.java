  /*  Objective: Understand the basic concept of inheriting properties and behaviors from a parent class.*
    Steps:    *
            1. Create a base class named Animal with properties like name, age and methods such as eat() and sleep().
            2. Derive a subclass named Bird from Animal. Add a new method called fly().
            3. In a main method, create an object of Bird, set its properties, and call its methods to observe inherited behaviors.
